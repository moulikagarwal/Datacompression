# Data Compression Using Huffman Coding

The project aims to develop a data compression model to encode the data with an efficient scheme and then using a decoder to decode the encoded message back to the normal result. To implement such a scheme, we use Huffman Coding and Decoding algorithm to achieve our end goal.
