# Data Compression Using Huffman Coding

The project aims to develop a data compression model to encode the data with an efficient scheme and then using a decoder to decode the encoded message back to the normal result. To implement such a scheme, we use Huffman Coding and Decoding algorithm to achieve our end goal.


### Running the application


```
$ make
```

```
$ make clean
```

```
$ java encoder <input file name>
```

```
$ java decoder encoded.bin code_table.txt
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
